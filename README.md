# 🧠 Natural Language to C++ Code Compiler

## Overview

The **Natural Language to C++ Code Compiler** is a smart tool that translates plain English programming instructions into valid, working C++ code. It identifies the user's intent, validates input, generates proper C++ code structures (like loops, conditionals, functions), and even allows execution. It also provides error feedback, performance suggestions, and the option to reverse code into pseudocode for learning purposes.

This compiler aims to make C++ coding simpler for beginners, educators, and developers by eliminating syntax complexity and allowing logic-focused development.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Intent Detection**: Understands if the user wants to create a loop, declare a variable, define a function, etc.
- 🛠️ **Code Generation**: Generates accurate, readable, and formatted C++ code.
- 🧠 **Syntax Correction**: Detects and auto-fixes basic syntactic issues before compilation.
- 🔁 **Reverse Mode**: Converts C++ code back into pseudocode for easy learning.
- 📄 **Documentation Generator**: Automatically creates inline documentation.
- 📈 **Performance Analyzer**: Suggests improvements and flags inefficient code.
- ⚠️ **Error Logger**: Logs and reports all issues and corrections.
- 💬 **Examples & Help**: Offers real-time help, examples, and manual support.
- 🌍 **Language-Ready**: Designed for future support of additional programming languages.

## 🖥️ System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows, Linux, or macOS  
- **Compiler**: GCC (for compiling generated C++ code)  
- **C++ Version**: C++17 or higher  
- **Java (optional)**: For future GUI integration  
- **Python 3 (optional)**: If used for NLP preprocessing (experimental)
