# 🧠 Natural Language to C++ Code Compiler

## Overview

The **Natural Language to C++ Code Compiler** is a smart tool that translates plain English programming instructions into valid, working C++ code. It identifies the user's intent, validates input, generates proper C++ code structures (like loops, conditionals, functions), and even allows execution. It also provides error feedback, performance suggestions, and the option to reverse code into pseudocode for learning purposes.

This compiler aims to make C++ coding simpler for beginners, educators, and developers by eliminating syntax complexity and allowing logic-focused development.
