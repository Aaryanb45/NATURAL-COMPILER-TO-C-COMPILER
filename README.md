# Natural Language to C++ Code Compiler

## Overview

The **Natural Language to C++ Code Compiler** is an intelligent tool that translates plain English programming instructions into valid, executable C++ code. It captures user intent, analyzes instructions, and generates syntactically correct and well-formatted C++ structures such as loops, conditionals, variables, and functions.

It also provides syntax correction, performance suggestions, inline documentation, and a reverse feature to convert C++ code back to pseudocode, making it ideal for both learning and development.

##Features

- **Intent Detection**: Understands commands like "create loop", "define variable", or "make function".
- **Accurate Code Generation**: Converts natural language to clean and functional C++ code.
- **Syntax Correction**: Detects and auto-fixes common issues before compiling.
- **Reverse Mode**: Transforms C++ code into pseudocode for easy understanding.
- **Inline Documentation**: Generates helpful comments alongside generated code.
- **Performance Suggestions: Flags inefficient code and suggests improvements.
- **Error Logging**: Captures and logs all issues in the background.
- **Future Language Support**: Designed to support more programming languages.

## Installation Guide

Follow the steps below to install and run the Natural Language to C++ Code Compiler:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aaryanb45/NATURAL-COMPILER-TO-C-COMPILER.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Folder

Once the cloning process is complete, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd NL-to-CPP-Compiler
```

### Step 3: Open the Project in a Code Editor

You can open the folder in your preferred code editor, such as VS Code:

```bash
code .
```

### Step 4: Compile the Java Files

Before running the transpiler, compile all Java files using the following command:

```
g++ -std=c++17 -o compiler main.cpp
```

### Step 5: Run the Compiler UI

After successful compilation, start the transpiler's user interface by running:

```
./compiler

```

Now, you can start converting Python code into Java using the Error-Resilient Transpiler!
